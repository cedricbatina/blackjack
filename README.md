This app I made, to renew my javascript coding skills. I revisited concpts like: arrays, objects, booleans, if -- else statements, comparison and logical operators. I also saw the for loops, the math() object and the return statements. First of all, I wanted to build a lil' game app' looking like the blackjack game. Then I changed the rules, as I wanted to work with numbers. Here are the rules. The player enters the game with 100 € chips. The goal is to reach 1000 €. He gets two initial numbers or cards from 2 to 11, randomly. If the sum of the numbers is equal to 21, then he has blackJack and the chips double, and he gets 200 € and so on until he reaches 1000 €. If the sum is less than 21, he's still on the run and can continue to play by picking up another card. If the sum of the cards or numbers is greater than 21, he loses 25 % of his chips and so on until zero, and the game is over. Good luck
